    -Develop the qualities of a good mathematician

What qualities make a good mathematican?

    -It's best to have a thorough understanding of mathematical vocabulary, 
    possess the ability to make connections within mathematics and recall numbers accurately
    
    -You also need independent thinking
    and an understanding of essential concepts
    
    -It can also be helpful to be able to persevere in the face 
    of challenges and learn from your mistakes.

How Much Does a Mathematician Make and the future of the job?

    -2022 median pay- $99,960 per year
    -Overall employment projected to grow 30% from 2022 to 2032 (3,500 openings a year)
    -Much faster than the average for all occupations

What are the Benefits of the Career?

    Salary:
        -$72,000 to $160,000 with the majority of Mathematician’s earning an average of $99,960

    Experience:
        -Through experience, there are additional skills that 
        math majors learn that are useful beyond the parameters of their occupation
    Autonomy:
        -Students who complete a degree in mathematics typically enjoy the subject. 
        Therefore, they may enjoy their work in a mathematics-focused career.
        The ability to employ your mathematics skills and contribute to humanity's development by solving complex tasks can be gratifying.

The value of being a mathematican?

    Future employers:
        -the amount of data created, captured, copied and consumed globally is projected to rise 430% by 2025. 
        That means more businesses will seek mathematicians to analyze the large volumes of information collected. This data will help companies grow, improve and develop new products and processes. Data analytics is also used to help businesses advertise to the right potential customers.

    Create new theories:
            -Some mathematicians work in a team or on individual projects to create new theories and concepts to further the mathematical field and increase the public's knowledge of the world. These people often have roles such as theoretical mathematicians and can create proofs and revise theories. They may also notice a pattern in the world that no one has explained yet and start to create a theory for it based on that data.

    Analyse Data:
        -Almost every industry uses data to improve its processes and output. Data analysts are a type of mathematicians that study data to find trends and patterns for businesses. They can use these trends to help businesses make data-driven decisions. This can include sales and financial data, demographic data and data about other quantifiable elements the business wants to know.
